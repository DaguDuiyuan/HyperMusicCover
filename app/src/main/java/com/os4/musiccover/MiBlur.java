/**
 * HyperOS's private blur methods on View, wrapped so nothing else has to know they are private.
 *
 * Only the four that the notification cards need are resolved, and only the non-gradient ones.
 * The gradient pair (`setBackgroundGradientBlurParams`, `setMiBackgroundBlurType(2)`) is
 * deliberately absent: the module this is ported from shipped the gradient path, hit a
 * RenderThread SIGSEGV inside `vulkan.adreno.so` under frequent updates on this exact GPU, and
 * removed it permanently in favour of a clipped hard edge. There is no reason to walk back into
 * that for a transition band.
 *
 * Every call is individually guarded and a method that is missing simply does nothing. These are
 * OEM privates with no stability guarantee, and losing one should cost a soft edge on the cards,
 * not the feature.
