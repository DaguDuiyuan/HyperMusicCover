/**
 * Holds the notification panel invisible until a pull-down has actually got somewhere, so a
 * barely-started pull shows no notifications at all.
 *
 * ## Alpha, and nothing else
 *
 * This writes exactly one property: the panel's {@code alpha}. It does not touch scale, and it
 * does not touch translation. That is a deliberate retreat from the module this is ported from,
 * which animated all three, and it was not free to learn:
 *
 * - **Translation.** The reference formula is `sin((f - threshold) * PI/2) * maxH * 0.4`, which
 *   at full expansion evaluates to sin(0.9 * PI/2) = 0.99 - it rises monotonically and never
 *   comes back. So at the fully-open state the panel is displaced by 40% of the screen. That is
 *   not a damped slide, it is a panel parked a third of the way off the bottom, and once it is
 *   on device it looks like a shade that cannot be closed, because the thing under the finger is
 *   no longer where it is drawn.
 * - **Scale.** `NotificationPanelView`'s scale is MIUI's own - it is mid-animation on it during
 *   every open and close (measured at rest, scale 0.99999994, which is MIUI's own curve still
 *   settling). Writing ours over theirs means the last writer wins on a property the OEM is
 *   animating, and the loser is the gesture geometry.
 *
 * Alpha has neither problem: it changes nothing about where the panel is or how big it is, so it
 * cannot make a gesture land somewhere other than it looks like. That makes it the only part of
 * the three that is safe to take over, and it is the part that carries the actual behaviour the
 * user asked for - a pull that has barely started shows nothing.
 *
 * ## The failure this class has to be built around
 *
 * A panel left at alpha 0 still receives touches. Every other failure in this feature is
 * visible - a wrong picture, a missing blur, an edge in the wrong place - but this one produces
 * an apparently dead phone with a blank screen, no error, and no way back except a reboot.
 *
 * So the hidden state is undone by a path that cannot be missed: {@link #apply} arms a watchdog
 * every time it hides the panel, and the watchdog restores unconditionally if nothing has moved
 * the state on. The watchdog is not a fallback for a bug - it is the only thing between a
 * stopped frame callback and an unusable phone.
