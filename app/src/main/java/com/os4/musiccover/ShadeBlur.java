/**
 * MIUI's shade blur providers: which one is the window-level blur, and how to drive it.
 *
 * HyperOS builds three `ShadeBlendBlurController$BlurProvider`s, one each for the shade window,
 * the notification panel and the control centre. Only the window-level one is the background
 * blur this module replaces - driving the other two would make the notification rows' own blur
 * breathe with the pull-down, which is a bug that looks like a feature.
 *
 * Picking it is the fragile part of the whole port, so the rule is written out rather than
 * implied:
 *
 * 1. The provider whose `onSlowdownBlurChanged` callback is non-null is the window one. Only
 *    the window provider is handed a callback; the other two are constructed with the flag that
 *    nulls it. This is the module ShadeIOSBlur's rule, verified on device, and the field is
 *    confirmed present on OS4.
 * 2. If more than one answers to that, the largest `maxRadius` wins, because the window blur is
 *    the expensive one. If that is still a tie, the module does nothing and says so - a wrong
 *    guess here is silent, and silence is what makes it expensive.
 *
 * The constructor hook is the only place `enableScale` can be cleared: MIUI reads that field in
 * its own `setBlurRatio`, and the constructor is where it is still ours to write.
