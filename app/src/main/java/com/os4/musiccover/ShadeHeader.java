/**
 * The control centre's own header - the big clock, the date, and the carrier group - moved up or
 * down by a fixed amount each.
 *
 * ## These are not the lock screen's clock, and they are not the content push
 *
 * Two things make this a different problem from {@link ShadeLayer}'s content push, and both were
 * measured off the tree before a line of this was written:
 *
 * - **The header is a different set of views from the lock screen's clock.** The lock screen's is
 *   `miui_keyguard_clock_container`; this one is `MiuiNotificationHeaderView`, and it reads
 *   INVISIBLE whenever the shade is shut. So unlike every other write in this module, there is no
 *   keyguard to be careful of here - the views are simply not on screen when it matters. The
 *   arming is still driven from the shade's own edge, because that is where the module knows the
 *   shade is up and it costs nothing to be consistent.
 * - **MIUI animates their translation itself.** Closed, `#big_time` sits at `ty=-187` and both
 *   `#date_time` and `#carrier_container` at `ty=-81`; open, all three read 0, and the clock is
 *   scaled 96x86 -> 312x192 on the way. A single write on the shade-open edge would therefore be
 *   overwritten before the pull finished - the edge fires at 4.5% and the header is still
 *   animating at 100%.
 *
 * So this is a DELTA SHADOW rather than a write. At pre-draw - after MIUI has applied this
 * frame's transform and before the frame is drawn, which is the only moment both are true - each
 * view's translation is read back and our offset is re-applied only when the value is not the one
 * we last wrote. MIUI is at rest almost all of the time, so almost every frame does nothing but
 * three float compares; when MIUI does move a view, we follow it by our offset on the same frame
 * instead of a frame later, which is what stops the header shivering the way the date does on
 * `all_in_one` (see Main's setNotifY note).
 *
 * The same bookkeeping is what makes the offset removable: what we added last time is remembered
 * per view, so handing back is "subtract what we added", not "set zero" - MIUI's own value is
 * under there and is its to keep.
