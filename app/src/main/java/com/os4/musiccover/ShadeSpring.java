/**
 * A mass-spring-damper, integrated on the frame callback.
 *
 * This is an instance and not the static one in Main on purpose. Main's spring drives the clock
 * from a single set of static fields, which is fine while one thing moves at a time - but the
 * shade has two springs alive at once (the blur and the curtain), and they have different
 * stiffnesses and must be able to run together. Sharing one would have them fighting.
 *
 * Hand-rolled rather than androidx.dynamicanimation.SpringForce for the reason the module it is
 * ported from gives: the copy of that library in SystemUI lives in SystemUI's own classloader, so
 * reaching it means either reflecting into it or bundling a second copy, and this is forty lines.
 *
 * Mass is 1, so `c = 2 * zeta * sqrt(k)` - the standard critical-damping form, and `dampingRatio`
 * reads the way it does everywhere else: 1.0 is critically damped, below that overshoots.
 *
 * The time constant depends only on stiffness and dampingRatio, not on the units of the value, so
 * the same class runs in ratio space and in pixels. Only the two rest thresholds are unit-bound,
 * and both springs here run in ratio space 0..1.
