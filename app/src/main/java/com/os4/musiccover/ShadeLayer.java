/**
 * The notification shade's cover layer: a full-screen ImageView behind the notification panel
 * that a pull-down reveals from the top down.
 *
 * This is a port of the ShadeIOSBlur module's controller. That module put the LOCK SCREEN
 * WALLPAPER there; here the picture is the module's own composed album cover, which is the same
 * bitmap that went to the wallpaper process - so the shade and the lock screen agree pixel for
 * pixel and pulling down is seamless.
 *
 * Two views, and the split is load bearing:
 *
 * - {@link #sFrame} is a FrameLayout carrying the alpha and the clip. It is what gets revealed.
 * - {@link #sWp} is the ImageView holding the picture. It is translated, not clipped.
 *
 * **Neither may ever be made clickable, focusable, or given a touch listener.** They sit under
 * the notification panel, and anything that takes an ACTION_DOWN there eats the swipe-to-unlock
 * and the notification scroll with it. The layer is drawn, never touched.
 *
 * Placement is the one thing that has to be right or the whole feature is invisible: on OS4 the
 * shade root has six children and the cover must go immediately below {@code NotificationPanelView}
 * (index 5), because indices 0-4 are MIUI's own scrims and background, which paint over anything
 * put there. That index is read from the tree, never hard-coded - see {@link #ensurePlacement}.

     *   parked. Expansion stops being written the moment the panel comes to rest, and the panel
     *   very often comes to rest while a finger is still down: measured, the finger at 48% with
     *   the panel already fully open and settled. Lifting then produced no frames at all, so a
     *   curve parameterised by `expansion` never ran and the edge stayed at 48% for good. A
     *   spring carries its own Choreographer, so it finishes whether or not the panel is still
     *   moving - which is the property that was missing.
     *
     * The destination is read from `expansion` when it is already at an end, and otherwise from
     * the direction the panel starts settling in. The settle is monotonic, so the first movement
     * that clears the noise is the whole answer; before it is known the edge simply waits, which
